# Neural-Network-Challenge-1

## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the process of analyzing student loan data using deep learning techniques. The project explores key factors such as payment history, GPA ranking, alumni success, and financial aid scores, among others, to predict student loan outcomes. I was provided assistance by Sean Morey, the instructor of the class. My classmate, Kyle Sellers, was a big help. I lastly could not have been able to finish this code without the help from the BCS Xpert Learning Assistant.

## Project Structure

1. Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file available online.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: The dataset is reviewed and examined to understand the structure and relationships between variables.

3. Data Preprocessing: Features are selected, and the data is cleaned for model training.

4. Model Building: A deep learning model is constructed using TensorFlow/Keras to predict the target variable.

5. Model Training: The model is trained on the prepared dataset.

6. Evaluation: The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated based on accuracy and other metrics.

## Conclusion

The final model predicts student loan outcomes based on various student metrics and loan parameters. The notebook also provides insights into which factors most heavily influence loan performance.
